# Data Visualization of US Mass Shootings between 1982 to 2022 Using Tableau

Since the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees the right
of American citizens to bear arms, in the United States, citizens not only have the right to bear
arms, but also can trade guns. But at the same time, the United States also has one of the highest
rates of shootings in the world. The United States Congress passed an Act on Violent Crimes in
2003 (The Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012), which stated: A mass
killing is a case in which at least three people are killed in addition to the killers themselves. This
dataset we analyzed contains data on mass shootings in the United States over a 40-year period
from 1982 to 2022. 

We believe that by analyzing these datasets, risk assessment, incident
prevention, and incident response can be improved to reduce the incidence of tragedy. In this
report, we firstly defined the problems we wanted to explore, then we used two data exploration
tools: Python and Tableau to help us achieve data preprocessing, data analysis and data
visualization.
